# AU/NZ Privacy Law Research Notes

## Australian Privacy Act 1988 - Key Requirements for Privacy Policy

Based on OAIC guidelines, an APP privacy policy must include:

1. **Entity identity and contact details** - Name and contact information
2. **Types of personal information collected** - What kinds of data you collect and hold
3. **How information is collected** - Methods of collection (direct, third parties, etc.)
4. **How information is held/stored** - Security measures and storage practices
5. **Purposes** - Why you collect, hold, use and disclose personal information
6. **Access and correction** - How individuals can access and correct their information
7. **Complaints process** - How to complain about privacy breaches
8. **Overseas disclosure** - Whether you disclose to overseas recipients and which countries
9. **Destruction/de-identification** - How long you keep data and how you dispose of it

Key tips from OAIC:
- Write for your audience, not as a legal document
- Be specific to your business operations
- Use simple language
- Focus on what matters to readers
- Consider layered approach (summary + full policy)

- Both require transparency about data handling
- Both give individuals rights to access and correct their data

## Terms of Service - Australian Consumer Law Considerations
